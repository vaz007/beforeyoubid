# Interview Question

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# npm start : To start the project

The project is based on  redux form and I have used react-router-dom to navigate to the next page. Furthermore I have used redux to manage state and axios to post request.

To send the request on the backend successfully, one needs to have a server configured. In this instance I have used Json-Server.
